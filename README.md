# Using the minimax algorithm to play simple games

The [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) can be applied to solve zero-sum games like tic tac toe, connect four, and Othello. I implemented the minimax algorithm to play these three games. In the future, I would like to add [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) to increase the speed and efficiency of the algorithm by eliminating pointless move choices.
